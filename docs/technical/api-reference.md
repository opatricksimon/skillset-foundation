## Overview

Skillset currently uses Firebase Callable Functions and Stripe webhooks instead of a public REST API.

Client adapters live in `src/lib/data`.
Backend functions live in `functions/src/index.ts`.

---

## Authentication

All callable functions that mutate user, course, payment, or enrollment state require Firebase Authentication unless noted otherwise.

Common errors:

| Error | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `unauthenticated` | User must sign in. |
| `permission-denied` | User does not own the resource or lacks required role. |
| `invalid-argument` | Payload failed validation. |
| `failed-precondition` | Required account, course, or payment state is missing. |
| `not-found` | Resource does not exist. |

---

## Course Functions

### `createTeacherCourseDraft`

Creates a teacher-owned draft course.

Request:

```json
{
  "title": "Advanced Product Design",
  "summary": "A practical course for product teams.",
  "category": "Design and creative",
  "categories": ["Design and creative", "Business and management"],
  "paymentType": "one_time"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "courseId": "course_document_id"
}
```

Notes:

- Requires authenticated teacher context.
- Normalizes title into `titleKey`.
- Validates categories and payment type.
- Prevents invalid duplicate title keys according to backend logic.

### `updateTeacherCourseBuilder`

Saves the builder state for an editable course.

Request:

```json
{
  "courseId": "course_document_id",
  "title": "Advanced Product Design",
  "summary": "Course description",
  "category": "Design and creative",
  "categories": ["Design and creative"],
  "modules": [],
  "priceAmountMinor": 9900,
  "currency": "USD",
  "paymentType": "one_time",
  "installmentsEnabled": false,

### `submitTeacherCourseForReview`
