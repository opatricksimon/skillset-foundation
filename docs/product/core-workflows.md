## Teacher Workflow

### Step 1: Account And Onboarding

**What:** Teacher signs up, selects the teacher path, and completes onboarding.

**Why:** Skillset must know whether the user wants to learn, teach, or do both.

**System outcome:** User profile has role, onboarding answers, and route destination.

### Step 2: Studio

**What:** Teacher lands in the studio dashboard.

**Why:** The dashboard should explain business status, courses, revenue, and required actions.

**System outcome:** Teacher can navigate to course builder, media library, payouts, plans, and settings.

### Step 3: Course Builder

**What:** Teacher creates a draft course, configures details, adds modules, lessons, content, materials, pricing, and preview.

**Why:** This is the core supply-side product.

**System outcome:** A `courses/{courseId}` document exists with builder data and a course asset subcollection.

### Step 4: Review

**What:** Teacher submits the course for Skillset review.

**Why:** Public marketplace quality depends on review before publication.

**System outcome:** Course status changes from `draft` or `needs_changes` to `in_review`.

### Step 5: Publish And Sell

**What:** Admin approves the course and it becomes publicly visible.

**Why:** Learners can only buy real reviewed courses.

**System outcome:** Course status becomes `published`; checkout or free enrollment becomes available.
