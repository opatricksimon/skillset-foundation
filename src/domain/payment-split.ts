/**
 * Marketplace payment split — canonical money math.
 *
 * Business rule (see DECISIONS.md D1/D2): the teacher absorbs the Stripe
 * processing fee so the platform keeps its full commission. The charge model
 * is `separate_charges_and_transfers`, so there is NO Stripe
 * `application_fee_amount` (that is a destination-charge concept) — the fee is
 * reflected by reducing the teacher transfer (`teacherNetMinor`).
 *
 * All amounts are integer minor units (cents). Money is never a float.
 *
 * This module is the SOURCE OF TRUTH. `functions/src/index.ts` mirrors
 * `stripeProcessingFeeMinor` and the ledger split for the webhook runtime
 * (separate Firebase Functions package) and must be kept in sync with this.
