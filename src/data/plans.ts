/**
 * Skillset pricing model — single source of truth.

 * optional monthly subscription. Stripe processing fee is passed through
 * to the creator on every sale, regardless of plan (see DECISIONS.md D2
 * and src/domain/payment-split.ts).
 *
 * If the user upgrades or downgrades, sales BEFORE the change keep the
 * commission rate from `plan_at_time_of_sale` (snapshot in the transactions
 * table). New sales after the change use the new rate.
