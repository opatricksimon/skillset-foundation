      {
        q: "How do students access a course?",
        a: "After enrollment is confirmed, the course appears in the student learning portal under Classroom. Progress, lessons, and any community spaces tied to the course are reachable from there.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I create my Skillset account?",
        a: "Click Get started free on the homepage. You can sign up as a learner or jump straight to the teacher application from the For creators page. The same account works for learning and teaching.",

    label: "Course creation",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Can creators upload courses themselves?",
        a: "Yes. Creators draft courses inside the Studio, attach lessons and media, then submit for Skillset review before marketplace publication.",
      },
      {
        id: "course-pricing",
        q: "How do I set pricing for my course?",
        a: "Pricing is set per course inside Studio → course builder. You choose a one-time price in the currency of your choice; Stripe handles multi-currency checkout at the learner's end. The platform commission (8% on Free, 4% on Starter, 1% on Pro, 0% on Plus) plus the Stripe processing fee are shown clearly in the wallet ledger for every sale.",
      },
      {
        id: "drip-release",
        q: "What is drip release and when should I use it?",
        a: "Drip release lets you make lessons available on a schedule instead of all at once after enrollment. Useful for cohort-style programs or to pace learners across weeks. Configure per lesson in the course builder.",
      },
      {
        id: "course-review",
        q: "How does Skillset review work?",
        a: "Every course goes through a Skillset review before it can be published in the marketplace. Reviewers check that lessons are complete, descriptions are accurate, pricing is reasonable, and any claims in the copy can be backed up. Typical review takes a few business days.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "plans",
    label: "Plans & commission",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Which plan should I start on?",
        a: "Start on Free if you're validating an idea — there's no subscription and you keep 92% of every $100 sale before Stripe fees. Move to Starter ($19/mo, 4% commission) once you cross about $475/mo in sales. Pro and Plus pay back as you scale further. The pricing page lays out the break-even point for each plan.",
      },
      {
        q: "What happens when I upgrade or downgrade?",
        a: "Upgrades take effect immediately — the new commission applies to new sales right away (Stripe Billing prorates the subscription automatically). Downgrades take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. Sales made under your old plan keep that plan's commission rate; the rate is snapshotted at the moment of sale.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if I cancel my plan?",
        a: "Cancellation downgrades you to Free at the end of your paid period. Your courses, students, content, and history are preserved — Skillset never deletes a creator's data. Commission goes back to 8% (the Free rate) on new sales from the moment of downgrade.",
      },

  {
    id: "payouts",
    label: "Payouts",
    items: [
      {
        id: "payouts",
        q: "When do I receive my first payout?",
        a: "Creator earnings move from pending to available 7 days after each sale — matching the refund window so cleared payouts never need to be clawed back. From there, transfers settle to your connected Stripe account on Stripe's standard payout schedule. The wallet panel in Studio shows the exact clearance date for every line item.",
      },
      {
        q: "How are creator payouts handled?",
        a: "Earnings are tracked in a payout ledger inside Studio. After the hold period, the balance is released to your connected bank account through Stripe Connect. You can review every sale, fee deduction, and payout line in the ledger.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "refunds",
    label: "Refunds",
    items: [
      {
        q: "How are refunds handled?",
        a: "The current model uses a 7-day automatic refund window with progress and certificate checks. If a learner has completed less than the configured progress threshold and has not received a certificate, they can request a refund directly from their order. Refunds appear in the creator wallet within minutes of being processed.",
      },

  },
  {
    id: "live",
    label: "Live classes",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Does Skillset support live classes?",
        a: "Today's model supports external live links (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.) and recording upload workflows. Lessons can include a live session link plus a follow-up recording so learners who missed the live stay on track. Native live streaming is on the roadmap.",
      },
    ],

    id: "integrations",
    label: "Integrations",
    items: [
      {
        id: "integrations",
        q: "What integrations does Skillset support today?",
        a: "Skillset connects natively with Stripe (checkout, multi-currency, Connect payouts) and Firebase Auth for sign-in. Course assets and media are stored in Firebase Storage. The Studio → Integrations page lists what is live and what is coming next — request a specific integration there if you don't see it.",
