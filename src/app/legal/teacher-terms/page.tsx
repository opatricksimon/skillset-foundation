              Skillset gives instructors tools to build courses, communities,
              live sessions, and paid learning products. Instructors are
              responsible for the accuracy, originality, legality, and learner
              safety of all materials they upload.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teacher access is self-service for verified accounts, but course
              marketplace visibility is controlled by Skillset review. Courses
              may be returned for changes, paused, or removed if they fail
              quality, trust, payment, or content standards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instructors may not upload content they do not own, misleading
              credential claims, unsafe advice, malware, private learner data,
              or material that violates applicable law or platform policy.
